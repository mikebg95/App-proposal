Train 'n Reap: a minimalistic workout journal app to save exercises and to plan and track workouts.

With the use of a JSON API request, the app contains a list of exercises, which can be saved or added to a workout. When added to a workout, the user can insert number of sets, reps and the amount of weight for each exercise. After all exercises have been added, the user must add a muscle group and a day to the workout, after which the workout can be saved. Each workout can be easily edited or deleted, and in this way the app is very user-friendly and minimalistic.
